This project utilizes existing bakery sales data to predict sales for upcoming special days, specifically holidays. 
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle [[link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthieugimbert/french-bakery-daily-sales)], 
and a separate dataset with holiday dates was downloaded from [https://publicholidays.fr/2021-dates/]. 
By merging these datasets based on holiday dates and incorporating relevant columns, I have created a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales for holidays, allowing the bakery to optimize its operations. 
Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, I aim to uncover valuable insights and patterns.

I have implemented various algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, 
and support vector regression to evaluate and compare their performance. The results and evaluation metrics
provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of each model.

By sharing this project on GitHub, I showcase my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. 
The code, along with detailed explanations and visualizations, enables others to understand the methodology and replicate the analysis.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data science in the bakery industry, 
highlighting the potential for data-driven decision-making and improved operational efficiency. 
The predictive model can provide valuable insights to bakery owners and decision-makers, enabling them to optimize sales strategies for future holidays.
